# ERC6909 in Cairo

[ERC6909](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-6909) is a new token standard that allows to manage multiple tokens by their ID in a single contract, currently being tested on UniswapV4.

TODO: Tests were originally written for version `2.7.0` of Cairo. The newest Cairo release (`2.8.0`) brings quite a few upgrades, so need to re-write all the tests.
